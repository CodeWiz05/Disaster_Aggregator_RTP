# !!! WARNING: This scraper is outdated and uses synchronous requests !!!
# !!! It also writes to a JSON cache file instead of the database.  !!!
# !!! It needs to be refactored similar to fetch_api.py to use      !!!
# !!! httpx (async), parse data, create DisasterReport model instances, !!!
# !!! and integrate with the run_fetchers_async function if needed.  !!!
# !!! It is NOT currently integrated into the main data fetching flow. !!!
