# app/verify.py

# --- THIS FILE IS LARGELY A PLACEHOLDER in the current simpler setup ---

# The core logic for marking reports as verified/rejected/spam and updating
# the database happens directly within the `process_verification` route in `app/routes.py`.

# The logic for aggregating verified reports into `Disaster` events is handled
# by the `find_or_create_disaster_event` function in `app/utils.py`, which is
# called from the `process_verification` route.

# API data from `fetch_api.py` is marked as verified (`verified=True`)
# when the `DisasterReport` object is created and saved to the database.

# You can keep this file for future expansion if verification logic becomes
# more complex (e.g., automated checks, ML integration, multi-step workflows),
# at which point you might refactor the logic from routes.py into a
# VerificationService class within this file.

# --- Example placeholder functions (not used by current routes.py) ---
